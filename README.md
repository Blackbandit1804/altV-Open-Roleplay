Open Roleplay is a base gamemode for Roleplay servers.
Open Roleplay is the base framework for my server: [alt:V Life](https://discord.gg/fc7P9eH).
Open Roleplay has its own [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/WbzTJXW).

### Licensing

If you'd like to remove the splash screens at any point; we can negotiate at a price. However, you will be responsible for removing them and not me. Otherwise, just leave the splash screens alone. This is a free framework and the least you can do is give credit. You are also required to put **ORP** in your gamemode for your alt:V server configuration. You did not write this gamemode; and it is not your **custom gamemode**. **Put credit where credit is due.**

### Feature List and Roadmap

You can find a full list of features and the roadmap [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19f9xTn6m3qVfUZYV6cQ8dMstLLdfYC2BavTV7YpzfLc/).

**IMPORTANT** If you are not a developer; this may not be the project for you. There is some general configuration that needs to be done and understanding code is important.

I **will not** be providing direct support for this gamemode; if you have an issue or come across actual functionality issues please raise an issue in the **issues** tab. Otherwise; additional help can be found by subscribing through [my twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/stuyksoft/) and then joining the [Discord Group](https://discord.gg/gVfJkcs)

### Installation

#### If you don't have NodeJS v12+; please go install it.

-   Install version **v11.5** of [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for either windows, linux, or whatever OS you're running.

-   Once installed you need to create a username and password for your database; and create a database called 'altv' or something else if you know what you're doing. **PAY ATTENTION HERE YOU'LL NEED THIS INFO**

**Creating on Windows with pgAdmin4**

Where to navigate:

Postgres is the username for this database; and altv is the name:

After; it should be running automatically in your services on windows. You can always restart your database through your Task Manager.

**Creating on Linux with Terminal ( UBUNTU 18.04 (Don't use 16.04 it's a pain in the ass.) )**

-   Follow these instructions up to Step 3: [Installing Postgres on Ubuntu](https://tecadmin.net/install-postgresql-server-on-ubuntu/)

-   Type: `su - postgres`

-   Type: `psql`

-   Type: `CREATE DATABASE altv;`

-   If all is well you will see `CREATE DATABASE` or something similar replied.

-   Type: `CREATE USER stuyk WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'abc123';`

-   If all is well you will see `CREATE ROLE` replied.

-   We now have a user called `stuyk` with a password of `abc123`. We need to assign to db.

-   Type: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE altv TO stuyk;`

-   If all is well you wil see `GRANT` replied.

-   Type: `\q` to exit.

-   Type: `sudo -u root`

-   This will bring you back to your root account.

-   Now follow the rest of the steps below.

---

-   Open a Power Shell or Command Prompt or Terminal

-   Download the latest version of this resource (100% Recommend CLONING the REPO with GIT).

-   After CLONING, CD into the repo through the same command prompt.

-   Open a command prompt and run `npm run orp`. **FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY ON PROMPT**.

-   When you get to the Discord Setup; make sure you hit 'yes' if this is a new server.

### Basic Discord Bot Setup

**Please Create a Discord Application for your Login System.**

**Please Visit: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/**

-   Inside of page you need to create a Discord Application and turn it into a bot and copy the bot secret.

-   You also **MUST** add this bot to your own server.

1. Hit New Application
2. Set the Name for Your Bot / Application
3. Click on the `Bot` tab.
4. Transform your Application into a bot.
5. Name your bot.
6. Tick `Administrator` or just `Send/Read Messages`

-   PM the Bot you setup with `!login <code>`

### Installation using Docker

OpenRP includes support for building and running the alt:V and PostgreSQL server using Docker.  Included is a docker-compose.yml which contains many variables that you will need to edit.  Any changes you make will require you to rebuild the altv-openrp container.

To build new containers, first edit the docker-compose.yml file and fill in all the details for the altv server and discord information, and then build with docker-compose.  Note: You must agree with OpenRP terms of service by passing TOS_AGREE=true as a build argument.

```
docker-compose build --build-arg TOS_AGREE=true
```

To run the containers:

```
docker-compose up
```

Please see Docker and Docker-Compose documentation for more options.
